# Dotfile Repo
This repo contains all of my personal settings for command line linux programs.
They are conveniently stored in categorized folders, and automatically symlinked to the correct location in the home folder via a clever use of GNU Stow.
Including but not limited to:
* zsh
* tmux
* vim
* emacs

Also included are any custom shell scripts I might find useful to carry around with me.

# vim
my text editor of choice for its efficiency in keeping your hands as close to the home row as possible.

# tmux
a modern terminal multiplexor which is actively maintained compared to screen. Biggest modification is rebinding the leader key combo to Ctrl+A

# zsh
I chose the Z shell for its extensive expansion and bonus features compared to the default bash shell.

# Emacs
My exploration of emacs begins with spacemacs, combining the power of both vim and emacs together! It's extensive set of plugins are self contained and updating to make life easy. Conveniently it has both a GUI and terminal version, but I'm still working on copy/paste!

## Plugin Managers
### Prezto
A lighter version of the popular oh-my-zsh, this provided a stable and tested place to start making my own shell modifications.

### lazyvim
a handy and optimized vim "distribution" with batteries included

## Powerline
Nifty modern looking effect for zsh, vim, and tmux!
