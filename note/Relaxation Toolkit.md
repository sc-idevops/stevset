# Stefen’s Relaxation Toolkit

In these trying times, it's helpful to have things to fall back on to help you calm down.

## Meditate

- [Calm.com](https://www.calm.com) is an excellent service for meditations, music, and even bedtime stories to help you relax and… be calm. They have a daily calm meditation that is updated every day with a timely thought or theme, and many specialized meditations to help you meet your goals. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/calmdotcom).

- [Bettersleep](http://bettersleep.com/): For those who have trouble sleeping, this website/app has completely custom soundscapes with individual sliders, bedtime stories, even relaxation routines called “Sleep Moves” to help you get better sleep. This is my absolute go-to of all my recommendations, I am particularly fond of their hypnosis tracks and cute stories. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/utopiansounds).

- [Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/medito-app): Volunteer run ad free meditation app. A solid choice with no commitment required!

- [Deep Meditate](https://deepmeditate.com): Another stellar app with personalized meditation plans and bedtime stories to help you any time of the day. Available only on an app.

- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) is another good meditation app, and also available on YouTube.

- If you prefer something more open ended for your meditations the [Meditative Mind youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMeditativeMind) has all kinds of nice background sounds.

## Listen

### Music/Sounds

- [myNoise.net](http://mynoise.net/) is a website filled with many sound generators which can help soothe you and transport you to different places with hundreds of custom top quality soundscapes.

- Another favorite is [Liquid Mind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgogqJdyUFxNWjdD69kyE5Q), an excellent series of albums of very slow relaxing music.

- [Atmosphere](https://peakpocketstudios.com) is a free app with a solid selection of sounds you can mix and match to suit your tastes.

- If you enjoy the calming lofi style of music, check out [Walking Dog](https://www.youtube.com/c/WalkingDogMusic), a DMCA free record label available on Youtube (or wherever you prefer to get your music from)

### Stories

- [Pzziz](https://pzizz.com) is an excellent app of sleep stories, soft sounds and is set up for a full night’s sleep or if you just want to take a nap! See also their spinoff apps:
   - [Doze](https://dozeapp.com/) A spinoff of Pzziz with a different UI.
   - [Mesmerize](https://www.mesmerizeapp.com/) Another highly recommended app, it has many pre-sets so you can relax faster with less thinking. The visualizations are engaging and the hypnotism is very effective.

- [Loona](https://loona.app) is an excellent app that has special interactive sleep stories where you color in a scene while the story unfolds! They also have regular bedtime stories and music to enjoy as well. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvOwxjPkjT8TdGrEP3IsxzA).

- Similar to Bettersleep, [Slumber](https://slumber.fm) has a huge library of bedtime stories and several relaxing sounds you can customize to help you drift to sleep.

### Podcasts

- The [Sleep with Me](https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com) podcast is always available if you need someone to drone on until you fall asleep. Scoot's quirky personality and creaky voice will lull you to sleep.

- Similar to Sleep with Me, [Sleep Whispers](https://sleepwhispers.com) is a recorded session of ramblings in a quiet almost ASMR like tone designed to give you something to listen to while you drift off.

## Watch

- Pluto.tv has several excellent relaxing channels.
   - My favorite is [Naturescape](https://pluto.tv/live-tv/naturescape): (it is unfortunate it can be interrupted by ADs but the view is nice for being free)
   - There are other channels if you just need something mindless on to have in the background making noise. You’ll also find [Bob Ross](https://pluto.tv/en/live-tv/the-bob-ross-channel) there too!

- Twitch.tv has several streams I find relaxing to watch.
   - More often than not [Bob Ross](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross) is painting pictures with his almost ASMR like voice.
   - Twitch also has [Cooking Shows](https://www.twitch.tv/hungry) running 24/7 which are surprisingly relaxing and 100% drama free.
   - One of the more odd streams called [Nothing, Forever](https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever) is a seemingly AI generated sit-com in the style of Seinfeld which never seems to end...

## Do

- Breathe. Really, just pay attention to your breath. It’s the most basic of tools you have anywhere and anytime to help control anxiety. You’ll find this a recurring theme in nearly all of my other recommendations.

- Writing down what’s on your mind can help dump out everything onto paper so you can come back to it later while focusing on relaxing in the here and now.

- Coloring something either digitally or on paper can be very diverting and make you feel like a kid again :)

- Talking with friends and loved ones can help you express what’s on your mind and together you can try to solve what’s bothering you.
